# Debugging
My Projects that I debugged

*Dice game 

- found bug the code didn't prevent values less than 0 or greater than 7
  from being used.

  - corrected it by changing while(this.currentRoll != 1) to while(this.currentRoll != 1 && this.currentRoll < 7 && this.currentRoll >= 0 )

  *Simple Craps

  - found bug user could enter invalid rolls 
  - fixed by addind if (this.value >= 0 || this.value < 13) {
  					System.out.println("Invalid roll ERROR");
										break;

										*RPN Calculator Did not find any bugs


										*Bowling

										- found bug where pins knocked down can be greater than ten and less than zero 
										- found bug where pins knocked down where between 9 and 0 instead of 10 and 0
										- fixed bugs by changing (Math.random() * (10) + 0) to (Math.random() * (11 + 0)),
										 and by adding if (rollOne < 0 || rollOne > 10) {System.out.println("Cheater");}

										 *Bank Account 
										 - fixed  print statement bug
										 -  changed   DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("#.00"); to DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("0.00");
										     to print out 0.00 if balance is 0 instead of .00 
										     - also removed unnecessary if statement wasn't really a bug It just wasn't really unnecessary.


										     *Class Roster
										     - found no bugs
